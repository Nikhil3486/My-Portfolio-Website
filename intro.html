                    <h6>HTML: </h6>
                    <p>HTML, or Hypertext Markup Language, serves as the backbone of the World Wide Web, providing structure and organization to web documents. Developed by Tim Berners-Lee in the early 1990s, HTML remains the fundamental language for creating web pages.HTML documents consist of a hierarchical structure, with elements nested within one another to create a logical flow of content. These elements can range from simple text and images to more complex multimedia and interactive components. By utilizing tags. Developers can specify the layout, formatting, and functionality of a webpage.</p>

                    <h6>CSS: </h6>
                    <p>CSS, which stands for Cascading Style Sheets, is a powerful language used in conjunction with HTML to define the visual presentation of web documents. Developed in the late 1990s, CSS provides web developers with precise control over the appearance and layout of HTML elements, allowing for the creation of aesthetically pleasing and responsive websites.

                        The primary function of CSS is to separate the content of a webpage from its presentation, thus promoting a cleaner and more efficient development process.</p>

                    <h6>JAVASCRIPT: </h6>
                    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a versatile programming language primarily used for creating interactive and dynamic content on the web. Developed by Brendan Eich in 1995, JavaScript quickly became an integral part of web development, alongside HTML and CSS.
                       Unlike HTML and CSS, which primarily focus on the structure and presentation of web pages, respectively, JavaScript adds behavior and interactivity to web pages. With JavaScript, developers can manipulate HTML elements, handle user interactions, and communicate with servers asynchronously, making web applications more responsive and engaging.</p>

                    <h6>JAVA: </h6>
                    <p>Java is a high-level, versatile, and object-oriented programming language originally developed by Sun Microsystems in the mid-1990s. It was designed with the philosophy of "write once, run anywhere" (WORA), meaning that Java programs can run on any device or platform that supports Java without the need for recompilation. This is made possible through the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), which executes Java bytecode.
                       One of Java's primary strengths is its portability. Once a Java program is compiled into bytecode, it can be executed on any device or operating system that has a compatible JVM installed. This makes Java ideal for developing cross-platform applications, including desktop, web, mobile, and embedded systems.</p>
